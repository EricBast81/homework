    "## 1. What does one need to do to use a module?\n",
    "To use a module you will need to install first with the install \" \" command.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.\n",
    "Random\n",
    "import random\n",
    "RandNum = random.randrange(1,1000)\n",
    "print(RandNum)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is the benefit of using Exception Handling\n",
    "Using exception handling allows you to run a debugging like function to make sure your code is doing what you want it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What are 4 components used for Python Exception Handling?\n",
    "Try, except, else, finally\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Numoy arrays are like what Pythin data type?\n",
    "Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. What is one of the main benefits of using NumPy arrays?\n",
    "Numpy arrays use less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. What is one of the main requirements about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?\n",
    "They must all be the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Of the 10 uses of NumPy, name 2.\n",
    "Arithmetic Operations, Searcing, sorting, and counting\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Name one of the other libraries we'll be using with NumPy.\n",
    "Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. What is the shape of NumPy arrays?\n",
    "Shape describes the array based on dimension, length, and size such as (2,3,4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. What is a Tensor?\n",
    "A tensor is an array with more than 3 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Name a reason why it's better using NumPy for Data Analysis that using a Python List.\n",
    "NumPy arrays are faster for processing so if you have a very large dataset you can cut down on time for something like sorting by a significant amount. This is due to the single data type found in NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. When creating an empty array, where do the elements come from?\n",
    "The elements come from whatever is in the memory allocated to the array."
